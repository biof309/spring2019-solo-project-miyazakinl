Rodent Activity Detector(RAD) device data analysis
=========


Code developed to analyze locomotor activity in mice over longitudinal studies. 


Description
===========

The code takes data collected by the RAD device as CSV files, concatenates all the data files into a single file, creates new variables (e.g. week #, diet assigned, # of bouts per mintue, seconds active per minute), and plots the average weekly locomotor activity for the 2 groups using a boxplot.
